# Blog Platform - README

## Project Overview
This is a **Blog Platform** built using Django and PostgreSQL. It allows users to read, like and comment on blog posts created by superuser while providing an intuitive interface for users and administrators. The platform is designed to grow with advanced features like user authentication, tagging, and a search system. The project can also be scaled further to include APIs, real-time updates, and modern frontend integrations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL

### Steps to Install:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Om-S-Yeole/Blog_Website.git
   cd Blog_Website
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up the PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE blogdb;
   CREATE USER bloguser WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE blogdb TO bloguser;
   ```

5. Update `settings.py` with your database configuration:
   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
           'NAME': 'blogdb',
           'USER': 'bloguser',
           'PASSWORD': 'password',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '',
       }
   }
   ```

6. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser for the admin interface:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

9. Open the app in your browser:
   [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)
